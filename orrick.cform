# [Company Name]
# Indemnification Agreement
This Indemnification Agreement (this ""Agreement"") is made as of [Date], by and between [Company Name], a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), and [Indemnitee Name] (""Indemnitee"").
    \ RECITALS \ The <Company> and <Indemnitee> recognize the increasing difficulty in obtaining liability insurance for directors, officers and key employees, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance. The <Company> and <Indemnitee> further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers and key employees to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited. <Indemnitee> does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and <Indemnitee> may not be willing to continue to serve in <Indemnitee>'s current capacity with the <Company> without additional protection. The <Company> desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as <Indemnitee>, and to indemnify its directors, officers and key employees so as to provide them with the maximum protection permitted by law.
    \ AGREEMENT \ In consideration of the mutual promises made in this <Agreement>, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the <Company> and <Indemnitee> hereby agree as follows:
    \ Indemnification \
        \ Third-Party Proceedings \ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee>, if <Indemnitee> was, is or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any <Proceeding> (other than a <Proceeding> by or in the right of the <Company> to procure a judgment in the <Company>'s favor), against all <Expenses>, judgments, <Fines> and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the <Company>, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with such <Proceeding> if <Indemnitee> acted in good faith and in a manner <Indemnitee> reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the <Company> and, in the case of a criminal <Proceeding>, had no reasonable cause to believe <Indemnitee>'s conduct was unlawful.
        \ Proceedings By or in the Right of the Company \ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee>, if <Indemnitee> was, is or is threatened to be made a party to or a participant (as a witness or otherwise) in any <Proceeding> by or in the right of the <Company> to procure a judgment in the <Company>'s favor, against all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with such <Proceeding> if <Indemnitee> acted in good faith and in a manner <Indemnitee> reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the <Company>, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which <Indemnitee> shall have been finally adjudicated by court order or judgment to be liable to the <Company> unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such <Proceeding> is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, <Indemnitee> is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.
        \ Success on the Merits \ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that <Indemnitee> has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any <Proceeding> referred to in {Third-Party Proceedings} or {Proceedings By or in the Right of the Company} or the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee> against all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if <Indemnitee> is successful on the merits or otherwise as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in a <Proceeding>, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee> against all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with such successfully resolved claims, issues or matters to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If any <Proceeding> is disposed of on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without
            \\ the disposition being adverse to <Indemnitee>,
            \\ an adjudication that <Indemnitee> was liable to the <Company>,
            \\ a plea of guilty by <Indemnitee>,
            \\ an adjudication that <Indemnitee> did not act in good faith and in a manner <Indemnitee> reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the <Company>, and
            \\ with respect to any criminal <Proceeding>, an adjudication that <Indemnitee> had reasonable cause to believe <Indemnitee>'s conduct was unlawful, <Indemnitee> shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.
        \ Witness Expenses \ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that <Indemnitee> is a witness or otherwise asked to participate in any <Proceeding> to which <Indemnitee> is not a party, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee> against all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with such <Proceeding>.
    \ Indemnification Procedure \
        \ Advancement of Expenses \ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the <Company> shall advance all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with a <Proceeding> within thirty (30) days after receipt by the <Company> of a statement requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any <Proceeding>. Such advances shall be unsecured and interest free and shall be made without regard to <Indemnitee>'s ability to repay the <Expenses> and without regard to <Indemnitee>'s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this <Agreement>. <Indemnitee> shall be entitled to continue to receive advancement of <Expenses> pursuant to {Advancement of Expenses} unless and until the matter of <Indemnitee>'s entitlement to indemnification hereunder has been finally adjudicated by court order or judgment from which no further right of appeal exists. <Indemnitee> hereby undertakes to repay such amounts advanced only if, and to the extent that, it ultimately is determined that <Indemnitee> is not entitled to be indemnified by the <Company> under the other provisions of this <Agreement>. <Indemnitee> shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery of this <Agreement>, which shall constitute the requisite undertaking with respect to repayment of advances made hereunder and no other form of undertaking shall be required to qualify for advances made hereunder other than the execution of this <Agreement>.
        \ Notice and Cooperation by Indemnitee \ <Indemnitee> shall promptly notify the <Company> in writing upon being served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information or other document relating to any <Proceeding> or matter for which indemnification will or could be sought under this <Agreement>. Such notice to the <Company> shall include a description of the nature of, and facts underlying, the <Proceeding>, shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the <Company> and shall be given in accordance with the provisions of {Notices}. In addition, <Indemnitee> shall give the <Company> such additional information and cooperation as the <Company> may reasonably request. <Indemnitee>'s failure to so notify, provide information and otherwise cooperate with the <Company> shall not relieve the <Company> of any obligation that it may have to <Indemnitee> under this <Agreement>, except to the extent that the <Company> is adversely affected by such failure.
        \ Determination of Entitlement \
            \ Final Disposition \ Notwithstanding any other provision in this <Agreement>, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this <Agreement> shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the <Proceeding>.
            \ Determination and Payment \ Subject to the foregoing, promptly after receipt of a statement requesting payment with respect to the indemnification rights set forth in {Indemnification}, to the extent required by applicable law, the <Company> shall take the steps necessary to authorize such payment in the manner set forth in Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The <Company> shall pay any claims made under this <Agreement>, under any statute, or under any provision of the <Company>'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws providing for indemnification or advancement of <Expenses>, within thirty (30) days after a written request for payment thereof has first been received by the <Company>, and if such claim is not paid in full within such thirty (30) day-period, <Indemnitee> may, but need not, at any time thereafter bring an action against the <Company> in the Delaware Court of Chancery to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, subject to {Attorneys' Fees}, <Indemnitee> shall also be entitled to be paid for all <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with bringing such action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for advancement of <Expenses> under {Advancement of Expenses}) that <Indemnitee> has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under applicable law for the <Company> to indemnify <Indemnitee> for the amount claimed. In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that <Indemnitee> is entitled to indemnification under this <Agreement> and the <Company> shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The termination of any <Proceeding> by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that <Indemnitee> did not act in good faith and in a manner which <Indemnitee> reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the <Company>, or, in the case of a criminal <Proceeding>, that <Indemnitee> had reasonable cause to believe that <Indemnitee>'s conduct was unlawful. In addition, it is the parties' intention that if the <Company> contests <Indemnitee>'s right to indemnification, the question of <Indemnitee>'s right to indemnification shall be for the court to decide, and neither the failure of the <Company> (including its Board of Directors, any committee or subgroup of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of <Indemnitee> is proper in the circumstances because <Indemnitee> has met the applicable standard of conduct required by applicable law, nor an actual determination by the <Company> (including its Board of Directors, any committee or subgroup of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that <Indemnitee> has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that <Indemnitee> has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. If any requested determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder has not been made within ninety (90) days after the final disposition of the <Proceeding>, the requisite determination that <Indemnitee> is entitled to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made.
            # Optional
            \ Change of Control \ Notwithstanding any other provision in this <Agreement>, if a <Change of Control> has occurred, any person or body appointed by the Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law to review the <Company>'s obligations hereunder and under applicable law shall be <Independent Counsel> selected by <Indemnitee> and approved by the <Company> (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such counsel, among other things, will render its written opinion to the <Company> and <Indemnitee> as to whether and to what extent <Indemnitee> would be entitled to be indemnified hereunder under applicable law and the <Company> agrees to abide by such opinion. The <Company> agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the <Independent Counsel> referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this <Agreement> or its engagement pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this <Agreement>, the <Company> shall not be required to pay <Expenses> of more than one <Independent Counsel> in connection with all matters concerning a single <Indemnitee>, and such <Independent Counsel> shall be the <Independent Counsel> for any or all other indemnitees unless
                \\ the <Company> otherwise determines or
                \\ any <Indemnitee> shall provide a written statement setting forth in detail a reasonable objection to such <Independent Counsel> representing other indemnitees under agreements similar to this <Agreement>.
            # End
        \ Payment Directions \ To the extent payments are required to be made hereunder, the <Company> shall, in accordance with <Indemnitee>'s request (but without duplication),
            \\ pay such <Expenses> on behalf of <Indemnitee>,
            \\ advance to <Indemnitee> funds in an amount sufficient to pay such <Expenses>, or
            \\ reimburse <Indemnitee> for such <Expenses>.
        \ Notice to Insurers \ If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to {Notice and Cooperation by Indemnitee}, the <Company> has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the <Company> shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such <Proceeding> to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The <Company> shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of <Indemnitee>, all amounts payable as a result of such <Proceeding> in accordance with the terms of such policies.
        \ Defense of Claim and Selection of Counsel \ In the event the <Company> shall be obligated under {Advancement of Expenses} to advance <Expenses> with respect to any <Proceeding>, the <Company>, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such <Proceeding>, with counsel reasonably acceptable to <Indemnitee>, upon the delivery to <Indemnitee> of written notice of its election so to do. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by <Indemnitee> and the retention of such counsel by the <Company>, the <Company> will not be liable to <Indemnitee> under this <Agreement> for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by <Indemnitee> with respect to the same <Proceeding>, provided that
            \\ <Indemnitee> shall have the right to employ counsel in any such <Proceeding> at <Indemnitee>'s expense; and
            \\ if
                \\ the employment of counsel by <Indemnitee> has been previously authorized by the <Company>,
                \\ <Indemnitee> shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the <Company> and <Indemnitee> in the conduct of any such defense or
                \\ the <Company> shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such <Proceeding>, then the fees and expenses of <Indemnitee>'s counsel shall be at the expense of the <Company>. In addition, if there exists a potential, but not an actual conflict of interest between the <Company> and <Indemnitee>, the actual and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by <Indemnitee> for separate counsel retained by <Indemnitee> to monitor the <Proceeding> (so that such counsel may assume <Indemnitee>'s defense if the conflict of interest between the <Company> and <Indemnitee> becomes an actual conflict of interest) shall be deemed to be <Expenses> that are subject to indemnification hereunder. The existence of an actual or potential conflict of interest, and whether such conflict may be waived, shall be determined pursuant to the rules of attorney professional conduct and applicable law. The <Company> shall not be required to obtain the consent of <Indemnitee> for the settlement of any <Proceeding> the <Company> has undertaken to defend if the <Company> assumes full and sole responsibility for each such settlement; provided, however, that the <Company> shall be required to obtain <Indemnitee>'s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, before entering into any settlement which
                    \\ does not grant <Indemnitee> a complete release of liability,
                    \\ would impose any penalty or limitation on <Indemnitee>, or
                    \\ would admit any liability or misconduct by <Indemnitee>.
    \ Additional Indemnification Rights \
        \ Scope \ Notwithstanding any other provision of this <Agreement>, the <Company> hereby agrees to indemnify <Indemnitee> to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this <Agreement>, the <Company>'s Certificate of Incorporation, the <Company>'s Bylaws or by statute. In the event of any change, after the date of this <Agreement>, in any applicable law, statute, or rule which expands the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes shall be deemed to be within the purview of <Indemnitee>'s rights and the <Company>'s obligations under this <Agreement>. In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its board of directors or an officer, such changes, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this <Agreement> shall have no effect on this <Agreement> or the parties' rights and obligations hereunder.
        \ Nonexclusivity \ The indemnification provided by this <Agreement> shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which <Indemnitee> may be entitled under the <Company>'s Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested members of the <Company>'s Board of Directors, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or otherwise, both as to action in <Indemnitee>'s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
        \ Interest on Unpaid Amounts \ If any payment to be made by the <Company> to <Indemnitee> hereunder is delayed by more than ninety (90) days from the date the duly prepared request for such payment is received by the <Company>, interest shall be paid by the <Company> to <Indemnitee> at the legal rate under Delaware law for amounts which the <Company> indemnifies or is obligated to indemnify for the period commencing with the date on which <Indemnitee> actually incurs such Expense or pays such judgment, fine or amount in settlement and ending with the date on which such payment is made to <Indemnitee> by the <Company>.
        # Optional
        \ Information Sharing \ If <Indemnitee> is the subject of or is implicated in any way during an investigation, whether formal or informal, the <Company> shall share with <Indemnitee> any information the <Company> has furnished to any third parties concerning the investigation provided that, at the time such information is so furnished to such third party, <Indemnitee> continues to serve in one or more capacities giving rise to the <Company>'s indemnification obligations under {Indemnification}.
        # End
        # Optional
        \ Third-Party Indemnification \ The <Company> hereby acknowledges that <Indemnitee> has or may from time to time obtain certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more third parties (collectively, the ""Third-Party Indemnitors""). The <Company> hereby agrees that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to <Indemnitee> are primary and any obligation of the <Third-Party Indemnitors> to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by <Indemnitee> are secondary), and that the <Company> will not assert that the <Indemnitee> must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Third-Party Indemnitor before the <Company> must perform its expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this <Agreement>. No advancement or payment by the <Third-Party Indemnitors> on behalf of <Indemnitee> with respect to any claim for which <Indemnitee> has sought indemnification from the <Company> shall affect the foregoing. The <Third-Party Indemnitors> shall be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery which <Indemnitee> would have had against the <Company> if the <Third-Party Indemnitors> had not advanced or paid any amount to or on behalf of <Indemnitee>. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the <Third-Party Indemnitors> are not entitled to the subrogation rights described in the preceding sentence, the <Third-Party Indemnitors> shall have a right of contribution by the <Company> to the <Third-Party Indemnitors> with respect to any advance or payment by the <Third-Party Indemnitors> to or on behalf of the <Indemnitee>.
        # End
        # Optional
        \ Indemnification of Control Person \ If
            \\ <Indemnitee> is or was affiliated with one or more of the <Company>'s current or former stockholders that may be deemed to be or to have been a controlling person of the <Company> (each a ""Control Person""),
            \\ a <Control Person> is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (including as a witness) in any proceeding, and
            \\ the <Control Person>'s involvement in the proceeding is related to <Indemnitee>'s service to the <Company> as a director of the <Company>, or arises from the <Control Person>'s status or alleged status as a controlling person of the <Company> resulting from such <Control Person>'s affiliation with <Indemnitee>,
        then the <Control Person> shall be entitled to all of the indemnification rights and remedies under this <Agreement> to the same extent as <Indemnitee>.
        # End
    \ Partial Indemnification \ If <Indemnitee> is entitled under any provision of this <Agreement> to indemnification by the <Company> for some or a portion of the <Expenses>, judgments, <Fines> or amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a <Proceeding>, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the <Company> shall nevertheless indemnify <Indemnitee> for the portion of such <Expenses>, judgments, <Fines> and amounts paid in settlement to which <Indemnitee> is entitled.
    \ Director and Officer Liability Insurance \
        \ D&O Policy \ The <Company> shall, from time to time, make the good faith determination whether or not it is practicable for the <Company> to obtain and maintain a policy or policies of insurance with reputable insurance companies providing the directors and officers of the <Company> with coverage for losses from wrongful acts, or to ensure the <Company>'s performance of its indemnification obligations under this <Agreement>. Among other considerations, the <Company> will weigh the costs of obtaining such insurance coverage against the protection afforded by such coverage. In all policies of director and officer liability insurance, <Indemnitee> shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide <Indemnitee> the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the <Company>'s directors, if <Indemnitee> is a director; or of the <Company>'s officers, if <Indemnitee> is not a director of the <Company> but is an officer; or of the <Company>'s key employees, if <Indemnitee> is not an officer or director but is a key employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the <Company> shall have no obligation to obtain or maintain such insurance if the <Company> determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, if the premium costs for such insurance are disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided, if the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit, or if <Indemnitee> is covered by similar insurance maintained by a parent or subsidiary of the <Company>.
        \ Tail Coverage \ In the event of a <Change of Control> or the <Company>'s becoming insolvent (including being placed into receivership or entering the federal bankruptcy process and the like), the <Company> shall maintain in force any and all insurance policies then maintained by the <Company> in providing insurance (directors' and officers' liability, fiduciary, employment practices or otherwise) in respect of <Indemnitee>, for a period of six years thereafter.
    \ Severability \ Nothing in this <Agreement> is intended to require or shall be construed as requiring the <Company> to do or fail to do any act in violation of applicable law. The <Company>'s inability, pursuant to court order, to perform its obligations under this <Agreement> shall not constitute a breach of this <Agreement>. If this <Agreement> or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the <Company> shall nevertheless indemnify <Indemnitee> to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this <Agreement> that shall not have been invalidated, and the balance of this <Agreement> not so invalidated shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
    \ Exclusions \ Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the <Company> shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this <Agreement>:
        \ Claims Initiated by Indemnitee \ To indemnify or advance <Expenses> to <Indemnitee> with respect to any <Proceeding> initiated or brought voluntarily by <Indemnitee> and not by way of defense, except with respect to any <Proceeding> brought to establish, enforce or interpret a right to indemnification under this <Agreement> or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, but such indemnification or advancement of <Expenses> may be provided by the <Company> in specific cases if the Board of Directors finds it to be appropriate; provided, however, that the exclusion set forth in {Claims Initiated by Indemnitee} shall not be deemed to apply to any investigation initiated or brought by <Indemnitee> to the extent reasonably necessary or advisable in support of <Indemnitee>'s defense of a <Proceeding> to which <Indemnitee> was, is or is threatened to be made, a party;
        \ Lack of Good Faith \ To indemnify <Indemnitee> for any <Expenses> incurred by <Indemnitee> with respect to any <Proceeding> instituted by <Indemnitee> to establish, enforce or interpret a right to indemnification under this <Agreement> or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by <Indemnitee> in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous;
        \ Insured Claims \ To indemnify <Indemnitee> for <Expenses> to the extent such <Expenses> have been paid directly to <Indemnitee> by an insurance carrier under an insurance policy maintained by the <Company>; or
        \ Certain Exchange Act Claims \ To indemnify <Indemnitee> in connection with any claim made against <Indemnitee> for
            \\ an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) by <Indemnitee> of securities of the <Company> within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the <Exchange Act> or any similar successor statute or any similar provisions of state statutory law or common law, or
            \\ any reimbursement of the <Company> by <Indemnitee> of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by <Indemnitee> from the sale of securities of the <Company>,
        as required in each case under the <Exchange Act> (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of the <Company> pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Sarbanes-Oxley Act"") or Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the payment to the <Company> of profits arising from the purchase and sale by <Indemnitee> of securities in violation of Section 306 of the <Sarbanes-Oxley Act>); provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent <Indemnitee> is successful on the merits or otherwise with respect to any such <Proceeding>, the <Expenses> actually and reasonably incurred by <Indemnitee> in connection with any such <Proceeding> shall be deemed to be <Expenses> that are subject to indemnification hereunder.
    \ Contribution Claims \
        \\ If the indemnification provided in {Indemnification} is unavailable in whole or in part and may not be paid to <Indemnitee> for any reason other than those set forth in {Exclusions}, then in respect to any <Proceeding> in which the <Company> is jointly liable with <Indemnitee> (or would be if joined in such <Proceeding>), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the <Company>, in lieu of indemnifying <Indemnitee>, shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount incurred by <Indemnitee>, whether for <Expenses>, judgments, <Fines> or amounts paid in settlement, in connection with any <Proceeding> without requiring <Indemnitee> to contribute to such payment, and the <Company> hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have at any time against <Indemnitee>.
        \\ With respect to a <Proceeding> brought against directors, officers, employees or agents of the <Company> (other than <Indemnitee>), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the <Company> shall indemnify <Indemnitee> from any claims for contribution that may be brought by any such directors, officers, employees or agents of the <Company> (other than <Indemnitee>) who may be jointly liable with <Indemnitee>, to the same extent <Indemnitee> would have been entitled to such indemnification under this <Agreement> if such <Proceeding> had been brought against <Indemnitee>.
    \ No Imputation \ The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the <Company> or the <Company> itself shall not be imputed to <Indemnitee> for purposes of determining any rights under this <Agreement>.
    \ Determination of Good Faith \ For purposes of any determination of good faith, <Indemnitee> shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if <Indemnitee>'s action is based on the records or books of account of the <Enterprise>, including financial statements, or on information supplied to <Indemnitee> by the officers of the <Enterprise> in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the <Enterprise> or the Board of Directors of the <Enterprise> or any counsel selected by any committee of the Board of Directors of the <Enterprise> or on information or records given or reports made to the <Enterprise> by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, investment banker, compensation consultant, or other expert selected with reasonable care by the <Enterprise> or the Board of Directors of the <Enterprise> or any committee thereof. The provisions of {Determination of Good Faith} shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the <Indemnitee> may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of {Determination of Good Faith} are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that <Indemnitee> has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner <Indemnitee> reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the <Company>.
    \ Defined Terms and Phrases \ For purposes of this <Agreement>, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
        \\ ""Beneficial Owner"" and ""Beneficial Ownership"" shall have the meanings set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the <Exchange Act> as in effect on the date hereof.
        \\ ""Change of Control"" shall be deemed to occur upon the earliest of any of the following events:
            \ Acquisition of Stock by Third Party \ Any <Person> is or becomes the <Beneficial Owner>, directly or indirectly, of securities of the <Company> representing [20-50]% or more of the combined voting power of the <Company>'s then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, unless
